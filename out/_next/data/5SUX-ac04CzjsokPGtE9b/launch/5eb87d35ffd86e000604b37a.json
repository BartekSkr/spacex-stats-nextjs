Most of the spacecraft will be delivered into low Earth orbit (LEO) in two deployment sequences separated by a second stage burn. These LEO payloads include the six Taiwan and United States owned COSMIC-2 microsatellites, the Planetary Society's LightSail-B demonstrator cubesat, and others. The third and final deployment will be the Air Force Research Lab's DSX spacecraft, which will be delivered to a medium Earth orbit (MEO). This mission will reuse the side cores from Arabsat 6A, which will return to LZ-1, and LZ-2. The new center core will boost back to land on OCISLY less than 40 km from the launch site.","flight_number":81,"date_local":"2019-06-24T23:30:00-04:00","id":"5eb87d35ffd86e000604b37a"}},"__N_SSG":true}
