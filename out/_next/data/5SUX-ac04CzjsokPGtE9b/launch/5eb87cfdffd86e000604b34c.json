Iridium NEXT will replace the original Iridium constellation, launched in the late 1990s. Each Falcon mission will carry 10 satellites, with a goal to complete deployment of the 66 plus 9 spare satellite constellation by mid 2018. The first two Iridium qualification units were supposed to ride a Dnepr rocket in April 2016 but were delayed, so Iridium decided to qualify the first batch of 10 satellites instead.","flight_number":35,"date_local":"2017-01-14T10:54:00-07:00","id":"5eb87cfdffd86e000604b34c"}},"__N_SSG":true}
