All previous landings from a ballistic trajectory had fired three engines on the landing-burn, which provided more braking force, but subjected the vehicle to greater structural stresses. The single-engine landing burn takes more time and fuel, but puts less stress on the vehicle.","flight_number":33,"date_local":"2016-08-14T01:26:00-04:00","id":"5eb87cfaffd86e000604b34a"}},"__N_SSG":true}
